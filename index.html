<p><a href="http://campusnorth.co.uk/">Campus North</a> has been such a big part in bringing the tech community together in Newcastle - providing amazing space for meetups.</p>

<p>They will be saying goodbye in December! Check out "<a href="https://medium.com/@campusnorthuk/thats-all-folks-e0a3c8acdb56">Thatâ€™s all Folks!</a>" by the team.</p>

<p>Thanks to all the team at Campus North!<p>

<hr />

<p>I figured it would be a good idea to provide a central list for people looking to run an event.</p>

<p>If you'd like to add your details or have any suggestions then feel free to open up an <a href="https://github.com/newcastle-meetups/resources/issues">issue</a> or <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/">pull request</a>.</p>

{% assign sections = site.sections | sort: 'position' %}

{% for section in sections  %}
